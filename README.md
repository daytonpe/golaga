# Golaga

Play Galaga in your terminal! Maybe learn some Golang.

## Running the Program

After cloning, simply run `go run main.go` in the terminal.

**Note**: If the game looks like it's skipping or blinking it's likely that your terminal refresh rate isn't fast enough. I use iTerm2 with some add-on packages, so this was happening to me. When I switched to original terminal, it started working correctly.

## Why?

As a new gopher I wanted a fun way to start with the language. I followed this [wonderful tutorial by danicat](https://github.com/danicat/pacgo)in which you build a terminal based PacMan game in go. Seemed that a fun next step would be to create a version of my favorite old game, Galaga.
